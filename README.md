Analysis from cluster 1

We have represented both the surviving and non surviving categories. People in the first cluster had 0-2 siblings in both survival and non survival category. We can say from observation that people with age 45 years or less survived while those who did not survive aged between 10 to 70 years indicating that higher age group people had little chance of survival. Passengers from class 2 and 3 had same chances of either surviving or not surviving. Cluster 1 had male passengers mostly in both categories.

Analysis from cluster 4

Passengers from 9-45 years belonging to non survivor category were present in cluster 4 while survivor had age between 0 to 60 years. Most people came from Cherbough and a little from Southampton. Both genders were represented  but females had a higher proportion. Passengers from all three classes survived in this cluster,but those belonging to class 3 did not. Siblings had a range of 0-2 irrespective of survival status.
